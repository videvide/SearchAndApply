# SCRIPT THAT CLEANS EXISTING FILE AND WRITES IT TO NEW FILE:
>>> new = set()
>>> with open('file_path', 'r') as fr, open('file_path', 'a+') as to:
...     for olink in fr:
...             new.add(olink)
...     for nlink in new:
...             to.write(nlink)


# SCRIPT THAT FIRST 'CLEANS' OLD FILE, THEN CHECKS FOR UNIQUENESS IN NEW FILE, AND IF TRUE APPENDS:
>>> old = set()
>>> new = set()
>>> with open('file_path', 'r') as fr, open('file_path', 'r+') as to:
...     for olink in to:
...             old.add(olink)
...     for nlink in fr:
...             new.add(nlink)
...     for alink in new:
...             if alink not in old:
...                     to.write(alink)


# SCRIPT TO CLEAN 'MAILTO:' WITH:
>>> with open('mails.txt', 'r') as f, open('newmails.txt', 'a+') as t:
...     for mail in f:
...             nmail = mail.replace('mailto:', '')
...             t.write(nmail)


# SCRIPT TO CLEAN AWAY THE SUBJECT PART OF MAILTO LINK:
>>> mail = 'mailto:linda@example.se?subject=Referens:EPM'
>>> mail_split = flow.split('?', 1)
>>> clean_mail = yes[0]
>>> clean_mail
'mailto:linda@example.se' # gl√∂m inte ta bort mailto!!!


# SCRIPT THAT CHECKS FOR 'UNIQUENESS' IN FILE AND IF NOT THERE, APPENDS IT:
	with open("links.txt", "a+") as f:
    		for line in f:
        		if link is not in line:	
    	    		f.write(link)
